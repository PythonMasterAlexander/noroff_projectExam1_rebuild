Rebuild of Project Exam1 for Noroff front-end Development

Teacher feedback on the original assignment
grade - B

The hamburger icon in the header is confusing. Why is it there? Add some left padding to the text inputs. 
The News and information pages could perhaps use a different colour for the item headings to break up the white text.

Your JS code should be split up into smaller files. There is no need, for example, to load all the API code on the 
contact page. When trying to submit an empty contact form, the email input displays a native validation message 

because of the required attribute. Don't use native HTML input validation (the required attribute) with custom JS 
validation. It presents inconsistent/duplicate validation messages to the user. As you allude to you in your report, 
you should display a message to the user if the API calls fail. A catch block that doesn't display anything to the 
user does not provide a good user experience.

Good unqiue page descriptions but the title length should be shorter.
